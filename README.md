# MonteFloor_Reproduction
Reproduction project for the methodology explained in the MonteFloor paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11161

To work with the code:

download the data: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XpKm3vjvw4lOw32pX81w0U0YL_PBuzez/view
and extract in the main folder.
If using this data, make sure to cite the MonteFloor paper

The weights for the different models will be kept up to date [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Mdap9B6BGweh3E80BBtpfaPKacVANTi4?usp=sharing)
Make sure to download them before testing the models and save them (for now) in the toplevel folder.
